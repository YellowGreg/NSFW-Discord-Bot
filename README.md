# NSFW-Bot
This is a Discord bot that I developed, which includes NSFW (Not Safe for Work) functionalities. The bot utilizes an API that was shared by a Reddit user.

# Installation
- Install the discord.js package by running the following command:
```
npm install discord.js
```
- Install the latest version of discord.js to ensure compatibility with the bot:
```
npm install discord.js@13.2.0
```

By completing these installation steps, you will have the necessary dependencies to run the NSFW-Bot successfully.

**Also the NSFW-Bot relies on an external API. You can access the API using the following endpoint: https://api-popcord.vercel.app. This API provides the necessary functionality for the NSFW features implemented in the Discord bot.**
