<h1 align="center"><strong>NSFW Discord Bot</strong></h1>

This is a Discord bot that I developed, which includes NSFW (Not Safe for Work) functionalities. The bot utilizes an API that was shared by a Reddit user.

<h1 align="center"><strong>Installation</strong></h1>

- Install the discord.js package by running the following command:
```
npm install discord.js
```
- Install the latest version of discord.js to ensure compatibility with the bot:
```
npm install discord.js@13.2.0
```

By completing these installation steps, you will have the necessary dependencies to run the NSFW-Bot successfully.
<h1 align="center"><strong>API</strong></h1>

**Also the NSFW-Bot relies on an external API. You can access the API using the following endpoint: `https://api-popcord.vercel.app` This API provides the necessary functionality for the NSFW features implemented in the Discord bot.**

<h1 align="center"><strong>Final Instructions</strong></h1>

To complete the setup of your Discord bot, you will need to locate the line of code where `client.login('Discord-Token-Here');` is, and replace `Discord-Token-Here` with your actual Discord bot token. This token serves as a unique identifier for your bot and allows it to connect to Discord's servers.

Once you have replaced `Discord-Token-Here` with your token, your bot will be ready to authenticate and operate within Discord. Make sure to keep your token confidential and avoid sharing it publicly or committing it to version control.

Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or require additional assistance.
